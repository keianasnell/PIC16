    "This part of the exam is optional*. If you are not satisfied with your ability to complete Part I, you may complete <i>one or more</i> of the three options below. If you do so, your score for the options you complete will be factored into your total score for the exam. The weights are: 20% for Option 1, 20% for Option 2, and 30% for Option 3.\n",

    "For instance, letâ€™s say you were to score 70 points out of 100 on Part I. <br>\n",
    "You also attempted Part II, Option 1, scoring 35 out of the 40 points available for that option. <br>\n",
    "Finally, you somehow had time to complete Option 3, scoring 18 out of the 18 points available for that option. <br>\n",
    "Then your grade for the exam would be:  70/100 x 50% + 35/40 x 20% + 20/20 x 30% = 82.5%. \n",

    "Regarding time: I wrote these questions over a week ago and attempted them again recently, so I remembered some of the concepts but definitely didn't have the solution code memorized. On this attempt, I even messed up a bit on Option 1 Problem 5 and crashed Jupyter during Option 2 Problem 1, so it wasn't perfectly smooth sailing. Still, each option took me about 20 minutes. I usually estimate that it will take most students about 3x as long as I do in these circumstances. So if you are fluent in the material from the first half of the course but didn't learn anything in the second part of the course, you could probably complete all three of these options during the exam and get a score of up to 70% for the exam. However, if you struggle through Part I and realize with only an hour left that it's not going well, you might only have time for one.\n",
